# Google Colab Integration with Gemini API

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google Colab with the Gemini API using the `google-generativeai` library. The code includes functionality to load an image and generate content (like a description or explanation) based on the provided prompt.

## Prerequisites

- A valid Gemini API key.
- Google Colab environment (or equivalent Python setup).
- Internet access to install required libraries and fetch images.

## Setup and Execution

1. **Install Required Libraries**  
   The script uses the `google-generativeai` library. Install it using:
   ```bash
   !pip install -U google-generativeai
   ```

2. **Configure Gemini API Key**  
   Replace the placeholder API key (`AIzaSyCpN1DSJegqmeF79dZ5JzAr_KRLzCUWgw0`) with your own key or retrieve it securely using the `userdata` module in Google Colab.

3. **Initialize the Generative Model**  
   The script uses the `gemini-1.5-flash` model for content generation.

4. **Handle Image Input**  
   - The code demonstrates fetching an image from a URL and displaying it in the Colab environment.
   - The image is also saved locally as `image.jpg` for further processing.

5. **Generate Content**  
   Provide a prompt like `"explain the image"` to generate text content using the Gemini API.

## Code Workflow

1. **Retrieve and Configure API Key**  
   Securely retrieve the API key using:
   ```python
   from google.colab import userdata
   userdata.get('GEMINI_API_KEY')
   ```

2. **Install and Import Libraries**  
   Install and configure the `google-generativeai` library:
   ```python
   !pip install -U google-generativeai
   import google.generativeai as genai
   ```

3. **Fetch and Display Image**  
   Use the `requests` and `PIL` libraries to download and display the image:
   ```python
   import requests
   from io import BytesIO
   from PIL import Image
   from IPython.display import display

   url = "image_url"
   response = requests.get(url)
   img = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))
   display(img)
   ```

4. **Generate Content**  
   Pass the image and prompt to the model for content generation:
   ```python
   response1 = model.generate_content([img, prompt])
   print(response1.text)
   ```

## Example Usage

Run the script in Google Colab or a similar Python environment. Replace the image URL and prompt as needed for your use case.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `google-generativeai`
  - `requests`
  - `PIL` (Pillow)

## Notes

- Ensure the API key is kept secure and not hardcoded in the script.
- Verify that the image URL is accessible and valid.
- The provided example uses a placeholder API key for demonstration purposes.
